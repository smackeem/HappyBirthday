                <p>I've been thinking about what to gift you for your birthday and nothing materialistic came to mind. For one, you can already afford most things, if not everything,  you want and I simply don't have the funds to get you the things you can't afford. So I'll just gift you with a little insight of how much I enjoy our time together and how much you mean to me.  </p>
