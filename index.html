            </div>
            <div class="letter-content">
                <p>So, your <span>birthday</span> is here, and I've been racking my brain about what to get you. 
                    But let's be honest, you pretty much have all the materialistic stuff covered, and I'm still working on my "get you things you can't afford" fund. It's a work in progress, as you know. 
                    In the meantime, I've decided to gift you with something money can't buy: a glimpse into how much I <span>enjoy</span> our time together and how you've become so <span>incredibly special</span> to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, where do I even start? It's crazy to think that we've only known each other for a short while, yet it feels like we've been friends forever. When I first laid eyes on you, I'll admit, I didn't give it much thought. 
                    In my mind, you were just another one of Keena's friends, and I was there to have a good time before heading back to the bushes and red dirt. 
                    But then, at JP's party, you pulled that unforgettable <span>"you're gonna get me in trouble"</span> line. I'm still laughing about it! Like... who do you think you are saying shit like that &#128514;! I was so confused at the time. I had no clue what you meant, and that was the last thing I expected from you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to our phone chats, leading to that January meetup just before I left for training. That's when I started realizing I kinda liked you. 
                    When Stefano mentioned Atlanta, you were the first thing that popped into my mind. I agreed to go solely because I had this sudden urge to see you. 
                    And that's when I knew it was more than just a casual liking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever since I got back from training, getting to know you has become one of the <span>highlights</span> of my days. When we're not chatting, <span>all I think about is you</span> (<i>queue the Ashanti</i> &#128514;). When we do talk, I never want the conversation to end. 
                    Your presence makes me smile, and when you're away, I wish you were right here. 
                    That kiss after Andre's brunch? It genuinely surprised me with the <span>passion</span> it held. I haven't felt that much spark since my first boyfriend, and I'm low-key excited to see where this goes (although foolish &#128584;).
                </p>
                <p>
                    But for now, I just want to say, <span>HAPPY BIRTHDAY</span>! Thanks for being a <span>beacon of inspiration</span> in this crazy part of my life.
                     Thanks for being my friend. Your <span>kindness, charm, and honesty</span> are some of the things that I like most about you. 
                     Your <span>kindness</span> isn't just a superficial act; it's genuine and heartwarming. You have this natural charm that lights up any room and leaves everyone in awe, and I'm no exception. 
                     Your <span>honesty</span> is something I truly treasure. It's refreshing and reassuring. But it's your <span>caring</span> nature that takes the cake. 
                     Your ability to make me feel special and cherished is beyond words. These qualities are just a few of the many reasons I'm drawn to you.
                      <br/>I'm looking forward to getting to know you even better and spending more time together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wishing you an awesome <span>BIRTHDAY</span> and hoping it's as <SPAN>special</SPAN> as you are!
                </p>
